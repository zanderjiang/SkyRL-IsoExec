# Inference

For training-to-inference weight transfer (`WorkerWrap`, broadcast vs. CUDA IPC, lifecycle), see [`weight_sync.md`](weight_sync.md).

## Architecture

- Key abstractions: `RemoteInferenceClient` , `ServerGroup`, `VLLMServerActor`, `VLLMRouter`
- `RemoteInferenceClient` interacts with HTTP endpoints: 
    - **Data plane**: Interact with router for completions requests.
    - **Control plane**: Fan-out to individual server URLs for weight sync, pause/resume.
- This is the new inference codepath enabled by default (`_SKYRL_USE_NEW_INFERENCE=1`)

## vLLM Router

- `VLLMRouter` in `skyrl/backends/skyrl_train/inference_servers/vllm_router.py` wraps a child process running `vllm-router`. 

## PD Disaggregation

Prefill-Decode disaggregation:
- **Config**: `enable_pd=true` passed to the `ServerGroup` constructor (`num_prefill` is a config key, not a ctor arg). Requires a `kv_connector`
- **Server groups**: Separate prefill and decode `ServerGroup`s, one per engine.

## Key Config Knobs

All under `generator.inference_engine.*`:
- `enforce_eager` (bool, default **false** -- `config.py:584`): With `enforce_eager=false` (i.e. by default), there can be more mismatch between inference logprobs and trainer logprobs. It is recommended to use off policy correction methods like Truncated Importance Sampling (see `docs/content/docs/algorithms/off_policy_correction.mdx` for details) to prevent logprobs drift. 
- `gpu_memory_utilization` (float, default 0.8)
- `max_num_batched_tokens` (int, default 8192)
- `max_num_seqs` (int, default 1024)
- `enable_prefix_caching` (bool, default true)
- `enable_chunked_prefill` (bool, default true)
- `distributed_executor_backend` ("ray" or "mp")
- `engine_init_kwargs` (dict, pass-through to vLLM EngineArgs)

## Placement
- Colocated: vLLM and training workers (FSDP/Megatron) are placed on the same set of GPUs. We offload/backload each component as needed. During weight syncing, model weights from vLLM as well as model weights from the training workers remain on GPU
- Non-colocated: vLLM and training workers (FSDP/Megatron) are placed on a different set of GPUs. This reduces the number of available GPUs per component by half, but is in fact the preferred setup for agentic RL with SkyRL. This is because non-colocated setups allow for asynchronous training, where training and inference can progress together. Inference is typically dominated by a long tail of stragglers, and is also typically the time consuming component, and thus using half the number of GPUs doesn't affect inference time for a batch as much.

# Legacy Inference Codepath

`_SKYRL_USE_NEW_INFERENCE=0` triggers the legacy inference codepath, in `skyrl/backends/skyrl_train/inference_engines/`.

## Architecture

- Key abstractions: `InferenceEngineInterface`, `InferenceEngineClient`, `RemoteInferenceEngine`, `RayWrappedInferenceEngine`, `VLLMRayActor` / `AsyncVLLMRayActor`.
- `InferenceEngineClient` (`inference_engine_client.py`) holds a `List[InferenceEngineInterface]` and itself implements the interface, so callers talk to it as if it were one engine.
    - **Routing**: prompts are sharded across engines by `route_prompts_to_engines` (respects `session_ids` for stickiness) — there is no `vllm-router`; the client does the fan-out.
    - **Control plane** (`wake_up`, `sleep`, `init_weight_update_communicator`, `update_named_weights`, `reset_prefix_cache`, `pause_generation`, `resume_generation`, `teardown`) is fanned out to all engines via `_run_on_all_engines`.
- Two engine implementations sit behind the interface:
    - `RemoteInferenceEngine` (`remote_inference_engine.py`): HTTP client against an OpenAI-compatible server URL; weight sync goes through `RemoteWeightLoader` over the same HTTP endpoint.
    - `RayWrappedInferenceEngine` (`ray_wrapped_inference_engine.py`): thin wrapper over a Ray `ActorHandle` (e.g. `VLLMRayActor` / `AsyncVLLMRayActor`) for in-cluster colocated engines.
- Optional OpenAI-compatible HTTP endpoint in front of the client is spun up by `InferenceEngineClient._spin_up_http_endpoint` (`inference_engine_client_http_endpoint.py`) when `inference_engine_cfg.enable_http_endpoint=true`.
