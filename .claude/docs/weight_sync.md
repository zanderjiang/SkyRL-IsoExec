# Weight Sync

Training-to-inference weight transfer. Runs after every training step (or on the configured interval) to push updated policy weights from training workers (FSDP/Megatron) into the vLLM inference engines.

## Architecture

Two-sided protocol with sender (training) / receiver (inference):

```
skyrl/backends/skyrl_train/weight_sync/
├── base.py                 # WeightUpdateRequest, LoraLoadRequest, WeightChunk
├── transfer_strategy.py    # WeightSyncInitInfo / Sender / Receiver / Strategy ABCs
├── broadcast_strategy.py   # NCCL broadcast (non-colocated)
├── cuda_ipc_strategy.py    # CUDA IPC (colocated)
├── weight_extractor.py     # Sharded-param -> dense tensor extraction
├── weight_extractor_utils.py
└── weight_loader.py        # WeightLoader ABC (sender-side driver)
```

vLLM worker-extension classes (loaded via `--worker-extension-cls`):

- `skyrl/backends/skyrl_train/inference_servers/vllm_worker.py` — `WorkerWrap`. **Legacy path.**  One or more calls to `load_weights(request)`.
- `skyrl/backends/skyrl_train/inference_servers/new_inference_worker_wrap.py` — `NewInferenceWorkerWrap`. **New path** (`_SKYRL_USE_NEW_INFERENCE=1`, default). Three-phase chunked lifecycle.

## Transfer Strategies

- **Broadcast** (`BroadcastTransferStrategy`): NCCL collective. Used for **non-colocated** setups. Training and inference are on different GPUs; weights cross the wire over a dedicated process group.
- **CUDA IPC** (`CudaIpcTransferStrategy`): Per-chunk packed buffer + one IPC handle per rank. Used for **colocated** setups (`colocate_all=true`). Both sides live on the same GPU; the receiver maps the sender's CUDA allocation directly.

`WeightSyncInitInfo.strategy_type()` returns the receiver class. Strategy choice is decided by the sender and the receiver picks up the matching class via the pickled init info.

## Lifecycle

**Legacy path** (`WorkerWrap`):
1. `init_weight_update_communicator(init_info)` — once per session. Constructs the receiver.
2. `load_weights(request)` — per sync. Receives weights using strategy-specific weight receiver and loads weights into vLLM.
3. `teardown_weight_receiver()` — on shutdown.

**New path** (`NewInferenceWorkerWrap`):
1. `skyrl_start_weight_update(is_checkpoint_format=True)` (`inference_servers/layerwise_reload.py`) — initializes layerwise reload (moves layers to meta device, wraps loaders).
2. `update_weights_ipc(update_info)` / `update_weights_nccl(update_info)` (`new_inference_worker_wrap.py`) — called repeatedly. Unpacks the SkyRL packed CUDA-IPC payload, slices the contiguous buffer per param, calls `model.load_weights(weights=...)` under `set_current_vllm_config`. *(There is no `update_weights_chunk`; that name appears nowhere in the tree.)*
3. `skyrl_finish_weight_update()` (`inference_servers/layerwise_reload.py`) — runs `finalize_layerwise_reload` (quantization repacking, attention weight postprocessing).

## Convention: vLLM imports

`vllm` is a Linux-only optional dep. Import it **lazily inside methods**, not at module top. Match the existing pattern in `new_inference_worker_wrap.py`.

## Tests

```bash
# CPU — chunk packing, transfer strategy unit tests, remote loader
uv run --extra dev pytest tests/backends/skyrl_train/weight_sync/ -v

# GPU — end-to-end WorkerWrap.load_weights (NCCL + CUDA IPC paths, TP=1 and TP=2)
uv run --isolated --extra dev --extra fsdp \
  pytest tests/backends/skyrl_train/gpu/gpu_ci/inference_servers/test_weight_sync.py -v
```

The CPU tests do **not** import `WorkerWrap` or `NewInferenceWorkerWrap`. Any change to the worker-extension classes must be exercised by the GPU test above.

## When to touch what

| Change | Run |
|--------|-----|
| `WeightChunk` packing / size accounting | `tests/backends/skyrl_train/weight_sync/test_weight_chunk.py` |
| Broadcast or CUDA IPC sender/receiver | `test_transfer_strategies.py` (CPU) **and** GPU `test_weight_sync.py` |
| `WorkerWrap` / `NewInferenceWorkerWrap` | GPU `test_weight_sync.py` (CPU tests will not catch regressions) |
| `RemoteWeightLoader` (HTTP control plane) | `test_remote_weight_loader.py` |

## vLLM version coupling

`vllm` is pinned in `pyproject.toml`. Weight-sync code paths are tightly coupled to vLLM internals (`model_runner.load_weights`, `initialize_layerwise_reload`). When bumping the pin, re-verify the GPU weight-sync tests for both the legacy and new paths.

## Gotchas

- The legacy `vllm_worker.py` and the new `new_inference_worker_wrap.py` are both live; the new path is the default (`_SKYRL_USE_NEW_INFERENCE=1`). Fixes to weight loading often need to land in **both** files.
- NemotronH / Mamba: vLLM's layerwise reload corrupts `conv1d.weight` via shared-storage view buffers. **STALE 2026-08-12: the workaround this bullet describes is GONE** — neither `SKIP_TENSORS` nor `conv_weights` appears anywhere in `skyrl/`, and the top of `new_inference_worker_wrap.py` contains no such code. Either the vLLM fix (PR #42481) landed with the pin bump or the workaround was dropped; re-derive before relying on this.
- After `update_weights_ipc` / `update_weights_nccl` runs, call `torch.accelerator.synchronize()` before returning so the sender doesn't drop its packed buffer mid-copy on the next barrier.
