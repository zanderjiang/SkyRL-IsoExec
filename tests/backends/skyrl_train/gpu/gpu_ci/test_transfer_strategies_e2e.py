"""
GPU integration tests for weight transfer strategies without involving the actual training workers and inference engines.

Tests the full execution flow with multiple training ranks:
    1. create_init_info: Extract config-derived args (master addr/port, dtype, etc.)
    2. create_sender/create_receiver: Initialize transfer components on both sides (multiple ranks)
    3. send_chunks/receive_weights: Transfer weight tensors between actors

This test uses 2 sender actors (simulating 2 training worker ranks) and 2 receiver actors
(simulating 2 inference engines, each with 1 worker) to test rank-specific logic.

GPU Requirements:
    - CUDA IPC test: 2 GPUs (each sender-receiver pair colocated on 1 GPU)
    - Broadcast test: 4 GPUs (each sender and receiver uses 1 GPU).

Run with:
    uv run --isolated --extra dev pytest tests/backends/skyrl_train/gpu/gpu_ci/test_transfer_strategies_e2e.py -v
