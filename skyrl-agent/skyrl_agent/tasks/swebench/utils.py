# I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory {workspace_dir_name}. Consider the following issue description:

# <issue_description>
# {instance.problem_statement}
# </issue_description>

# Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
# I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
# Also the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.
# Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the {workspace_dir_name} directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.

# Follow these phases to resolve the issue:

# Phase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms
#    1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.
#    1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.
#    1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.
#    1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.
#    1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue

# Phase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository
#    2.1 Follow the readme
#    2.2 Install the environment and anything needed
#    2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests

# Phase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions
#    3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.
#    3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.
#    3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.
#    3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.

# Phase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.
#    4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.
#    4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.
#    4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.
#    4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.

# Phase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it
#    5.1 State clearly what the problem is.
#    5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.
#    5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.
#    5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.
#    5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.

# Phase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.
#    6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.

# Phase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.
#    7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.
#    7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.
#    7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.

# 8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit {instance['base_commit']}.
#    8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.
#    8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:
#      8.2.1 The issue you are fixing
#      8.2.2 The files you modified
#      8.2.3 The functions you changed
#    8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass

# Be thorough in your exploration, testing, and reasoning. It's fine if your thinking process is lengthy - quality and completeness are more important than brevity.

    I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory {workspace_dir_name}. Consider the following issue description:

    <issue_description>
    {instance.problem_statement}
    </issue_description>

    Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
    I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
    Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the {workspace_dir_name} directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.

    Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
    1. First, explore the codebase to locate and understand the code relevant to the <issue_description>. 
    - Use efficient search commands to identify key files and functions. 
    - You should err on the side of caution and look at various relevant files and build your understanding of 
        - how the code works
        - what are the expected behaviors and edge cases
        - what are the potential root causes for the given issue

    2. Assess whether you can reproduce the issue:
        - Create a script at {workspace_dir_name}/reproduce_issue.py that demonstrates the error.
        - Execute this script to confirm the error behavior.
        - You should reproduce the issue before fixing it.
        - Your reproduction script should also assert the expected behavior for the fixed code. 

    3. Analyze the root cause:
        - Identify the underlying problem based on your code exploration and reproduction results.
        - Critically analyze different potential approaches to fix the issue. 
        - You NEED to explicitly reason about multiple approaches to fix the issue. Next, find the most elegant and effective solution among them considering the tradeoffs (correctness, generality, side effects, etc.).
        - You would need to reason about execution paths, edge cases, and other potential issues. You should look at the unit tests to understand the expected behavior of the relevant code.

    4. Implement your solution:
        - Make targeted changes to the necessary files following idiomatic code patterns once you determine the root cause.
        - You should be thorough and methodical.

    5. Verify your solution:
        - Rerun your reproduction script to confirm the error is fixed.
        - If verification fails, iterate on your solution until successful. If you identify the reproduction script is buggy, adjust it as needed.

    6. Run unit tests:
        - Find and run the relevant unit tests relevant to the performed fix.
        - You should run the unit tests to ensure your solution is correct and does not cause any regressions.
        - In cases where the unit tests are do not pass, you should consider whether the unit tests does not reflect the *new* expected behavior of the code. If so, you can test it by writing additional edge test cases.
        - Use the existing test runner to run the unit tests you identify as relevant to the changes you made. For example:
            - `python -m pytest -xvs sympy/physics/units/tests/test_dimensions_transcendental.py`
            - `python -m pytest tests/test_domain_py.py::test_pymethod_options`
            - `./tests/runtests.py constraints.tests.CheckConstraintTests -v 2`
        - RUN ALL relevant unit tests to ensure your solution is correct and does not cause any regressions.

    7. Test edge cases:
        - Identify potential edge cases that might challenge your solution.
        - Create additional test cases in a separate file {workspace_dir_name}/edge_case_tests.py.
        - Execute these tests to verify your solution's robustness.
        - You should run multiple rounds of edge cases. When creating edge cases:
        - Consider complex scenarios beyond the original issue description
        - Test for regressions to ensure existing functionality remains intact

    8. Refine if necessary:
        - If edge case testing reveals issues, refine your solution accordingly.
        - Ensure your final implementation handles all identified scenarios correctly.
        - Document any assumptions or limitations of your solution.

    9. Submit your solution:
        - Once you have verified your solution, submit your solution using the `finish` tool.

    A successful resolution means:
    - The specific error/issue described no longer occurs
    - Your changes maintain compatibility with existing functionality
    - Edge cases are properly handled
